## Setup

- The eight ranks are numbered `1` through `8` beginning with the rank closest to White
- The files are labelled `a` through `h` beginning with the file at White's left hand

- Castling: The king moves two spaces to the left or to the right, and the rook moves over and in front of the king, all in one move!

  - Rules for castling:

    - Your king can not have moved
    - Your rook can not have moved
    - Your king can NOT be in check
    - Your king can not pass through check
    - No pieces can be between the king and rook
