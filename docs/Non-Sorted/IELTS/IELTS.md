Good habits:

1. Synonym and Paraphrase Tables:

   - This practice habit helps you to get better at recognising how they disguise answers so that you can select the correct answer
   - Also, this habit helps you avoid picking the wrong answer choice

   - Do a listening practice
   - If you use the proper course strategy, you have already noted the Question Keywords
   - After you have answered the questions, put the Question Keywords on the left and Passage Matches on the right

2. Tracking and Analysing Mistakes:

   - This practice habit helps you to get better at your application of proper strategy
   - It also helps you to stop making the same mistakes over and over again

   - For every Question you answer incorrectly, put the question on the left and the mistake you made on the right side of the table
   - When analysing explain hoe you answered incorrectly. What was the trap or incorrect application of strategy?

3. Vocabulary - New and Misspelled:

   - Every time you do a listening practice do two activities:

   - Keep a RUNNING list (keep adding to the same list)
