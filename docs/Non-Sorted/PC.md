# PC Building Guide

Every PC can be broken down into 7 discrete components or parts:

- CPU/Processor
- [Motherboard/Mainboard](#motherboard)
- [Memory/RAM](#ram)
- Graphics Card/Video Card
- Storage (HDD, SSD)
- Power Supply Unit/PSU
- Case/Cabinet

## Motherboard

Motherboard Form Factors:

- Intel developed the ATX specification in 1995 to standardize board design

The most common form factors:

- **ATX (Advanced Technology eXtended)** - One of the most popular form factors. It offers a fairly standard layout and usually features 4 DIMM (memory/RAM) slots along with multiple full-length (x8/x16) PCI-E slots

- **E-ATX (Extended ATX)** - One of the largest form factors available for mainstream use. It typically offers the most features and extensibility – giving you flexibility with regards to peripherals. These motherboards should come with 3 or more full-length PCI-E slots

- **M-ATX (Micro ATX)** - A compact implementation of the ATX standard. It usually features 2 or 4-DIMM configurations for memory and very rarely features more than 2 full-length PCI-E slots. It’s an excellent choice for those wanting a reasonably compact build

- **M-ITX (Mini ITX)** - One of the most compact form factors widely available for mainstream computers. Although they have limited extensibility due to their diminutive size, they have no peer when it comes to building compact PCs

- XL-ATX, E-ATX, ATX, M-ATX, ITX

Intel-compatible motherboard for an Intel CPU and an AMD-compatible motherboard for an AMD CPU

Both brands use different socket types, and that is why **you can’t swap CPUs from different brands**. Sockets can even vary across processor generations from the same company

| Brand | Generation                                          | Socket         | Reason                                                          |
| ----- | --------------------------------------------------- | -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Intel | 12th Gen Core i9, i7, and i5 Processirs (K series)  | z690/B660      | 'K' CPUs from Intel have unlocked cores and can be overclocked. |
|       |                                                     |                | Only the Z690 chipsets support this capability                  |
|       | Intel HEDT X-Series CPUs 9th and 10th Gen           | X299           | Only available Chipset for 9th and 10th gen Intel X-Series CPUs |
| AMD   | AMD Ryzen Processors (1st, 2nd, and 3rd Generation) | X570/B450/A320 | All motherboards with these chipsets come with an AM4 socket    |
|       | and AMD Ryzen-Based APUs (2400G, 3400G, etc.)       |                | Pick according to your budget and requirements                  |
|       | AMD Ryzen Threadripper Processors (1st and 2nd Gen) | X399           | Only available Chipset for 1st and 2nd Gen Threadripper CPUs    |
|       | AMD Ryzen Threadripper Processors (3rd Gen)         | TRX40          | Only available Chipset for 3rd Gen Threadripper CPUs            |

## RAM

Depending on its form factor, you'll mostly have access to 2, 4 or 8 RAM slots on your motherboard of choice
