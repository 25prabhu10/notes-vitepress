## Salary Expectations

- Before I came in for interview, I did some research to assess the average salary range for this position within this industry, and the average salary range was between 30 and 37000 dollars. Although I feel I am worth the higher salary range of 37000 dollars. I understand that you don't know me, and I have a responsibility to prove to you my worth. So, on that basis, I would be comfortable with a salary of 35000 and I believe, based on my hard-working nature, my ability to get up and running quickly in the role, and my commitment to your company brand, you will soon see a positive return on your investment

- Research the average salary range:

  - [PayScale](https://www.payscale.com/)
  - [Glassdoor](https://www.glassdoor.co.in/)

- Ask for a salary that is slightly below the highest range of the average

- Justify why you are worth this salary
