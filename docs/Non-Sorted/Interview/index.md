"I have interviewed at a number of different companies for various positions. I received a written offer for one of the positions that would be an excellent fit for my qualifications and this offer was received after we scheduled this interview. The truth is, I believe the position you are offering me is an even better fit for my qualifications, but the salary you are offering is less than the other offer I have. This presents a challenging dilemma for me as you might imagine. Is there a possibility of meeting or improving upon the salary identified in this other offer? I can show you the other offer if that would be helpful."

[How much salary do you expect?](https://www.indiabix.com/hr-interview/how-much-salary-do-you-expect/)

- "That you have evaluated me and let me know where i fit in terms of your budget, there are industry standards"

- "While I am certainly flexible, I am looking to receive between ₹8 lakh and ₹10 lakh annually. Due to my skill set and experience level, I feel that this is a comfortable and appropriate salary range for my work."

- "My baseline salary requirement is ₹8 lakh per annum. The value and expertise I can bring to this role support my compensation expectations. Is this in line with your thoughts?"

- "Let me start by reiterating how grateful I am for the benefits this job offers, such as generous paid time off and health benefits. That being said, I am expecting my salary for this position to fall between ₹7 lakh and ₹9 lakh annually. My rich background in client services specific to this industry can play a role in strengthening the organisation."

- "Thank you for asking. I feel that an annual salary between ₹5 lakh and ₹7 lakh is in line with the industry average and well reflects my skills and experience level. I am, however, flexible and open to hearing about the company's compensation expectations for this position."

- "I am seeking a position that pays between ₹12 lakh to ₹15 lakh annually, but I am open to negotiate salary depending on benefits, bonuses, equity, stock options and other opportunities."

- "I'd like to learn more about the role and its responsibilities before discussing salary expectations. But may I ask what salary range you consider for this role?".

- I expect salary based on Industry standards & skill sets, knowledge.

- I would be interested in hearing the salary range for this position before I commit to a figure.

[Reason for Job Change?](https://in.indeed.com/career-advice/interviewing/reason-for-job-change)

- "I left my last job because I realised that my skills and aspirations were not aligned with the position. The company was great but the position did not offer enough challenges to fully utilise my skills and abilities. I have read about the work culture and value system of your company. The job description blends well with my long-term career goals. Given my excellent resource utilisation skills, I am optimistic about adding immense value to this position."

- "My biggest reason for leaving is that I'm ready to take on more responsibility. I want to manage a team, but there are no leadership positions available at my current employer. I enjoy delivering training sessions and upskilling junior employees. It's something I do a lot in my current role, and I've received lots of positive feedback, but I could do this even more effectively if I had my own team. I know you're looking for someone to lead a small team of graduates and I'm really excited about the prospect of helping them to develop."

- I want to learn more
- I feel like I'm ready to take on more responsibility
- I believe I've progressed as far as I can in my current role
- I need a change of environment to motivate me
- I want to develop a new skill that isn't required in my current job
- I don't feel like my current role is challenging me any more
