- **Bonds**: Long-term promissory note, issued by a borrower, promising to its holder a predetermined and fixed amount of interest per year and repayment of principal at maturity

- Type of debt
- Owners of bonds are like debt-holders or creditors

Characteristics of Bonds:

1. Par Value: Face value of the bond, returned to the bondholder at maturity

2. Price: Represented as a % of face value or Par

   - _Example:_ A bond quoted at 112 cab be bought at 112% of its par value in the market. Bonds will return the par value at maturity, regardless of the price paid at the time of Purchase

3. Coupon: The percentage of the par value of the bond that will be paid periodically in the form of interest

   - _Example:_ If James buys a bond with a $1000 par value and 5% annual coupon rate, it will pay him $50 annually (=0.05x1000) or $25 (if interest is paid semi-annually). Some bonds, called zero coupon bonds have zero or very low coupon rate. Instead of paying interest, the bonds are issues at a substantial discount below the par or face value

4. maturity: The length of time until the bond issuer returns the par value to the bondholder and terminates or redeems the bond

5. Yield: The rate of return that the investor will earn on the bond after taking into account the price paid for the bond and the coupon on the bond

Bond Rating: Reflects the future risk potential of the bonds

- investment Grade: Aaa to Baa3

### S&P 500

The S&P 500 is the world's most popular stock market index. The largest fund that is benchmarked to this index is the SPDR® S&P 500® ETF Trust. It has more than US$250 billion of assets under management

One of the most important characteristics of the S&P 500 is that it is market capitalization-weighted

This means that larger companies get a correspondingly larger weight in the index

- Equal-Weight S&P 500 Index Fund: The goal of this section of the course is to create a Python script that will accept the value of your portfolio and tell you how many shares of each S&P 500 constituent you should purchase to get an equal-weight version of the index fund

- Quantitative Momentum Strategy: **"Momentum investing"** means investing in the stocks that have increased in price the most

Imagine that you have the choice of investing in two stocks that have been had the following returns over the last year:

- Apple (AAPL): 35%
- Microsoft (MSFT): 20%

A momentum investing strategy would suggest investing in Apple because of its higher recent price return

For this project, we're going to build an investing strategy that selects the 50 stocks with the highest price momentum. From there, we will calculate recommended trades for an equal-weight portfolio of these 50 stocks

- Quantitative Value Strategy: **"Value investing"** means investing in the stocks that are cheapest relative to common measures of business value (like earnings or assets)

Value investing was popularized by investors like Warren Buffett, Seth Klarman, and Benjamin Graham

Creating algorithmic value investing strategies relies on a concept called _multiples_

Multiples are calculated by dividing company's stock price by some measure of the company's worth - like earnings or assets

Here are a few examples of common multiples used in value investing:

- Price-to-earnings
- Price-to-book-value
- Price-to-free-cash-flow

Each of the individual multiples used by value investors has its pros and cons. One way to minimize the impact of any specific multiple is by using a composite

For this project, we're going to build an investing strategy that selects the 50 stocks with the best value metrics. From there, we will calculate recommended trades for an equal-weight portfolio of these 50 stocks
