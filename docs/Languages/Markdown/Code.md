# Code Blocks

Code blocks are used to insert raw code.

Some markdown engines support syntax highlighting.

- Use 4 spaces or 1 tab

- Inline code blocks using ```

This is a `inline Code Blocks`  
This contains <> in `<blink>`  
This contains & in `&blink`

## Syntax Highlighting

You can define the language to be used for syntax highlighting by adding name on the opening tag.

Like...

```markdown
\`\`\`javascript
var a = {};
\`\`\`
```
