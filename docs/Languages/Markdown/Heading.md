# Heading

There are 6 levels of headings.

## Styles for Heading

1. The _Setext_ (Structure Enhanced Text) style uses `===` and `---` for **H1** and **H2** respectively and _Atx-Style_ for level 3 or more.

2. The _Atx-Style_ uses **#** (as prefix) for levels 1 to 6 with increasing **#** for each levels.

   ```markdown
   use # for H1 and so on

   ## H2

   ### H3

   #### H4

   ##### H5

   ###### H6
   ```

## Notes

- All markdown documents always start with a heading level 1.
- The change in levels must always be incremental, like after level 2 comes level 3 and not level 4.

::: tip
Insert a blank space around atx-style heading.
