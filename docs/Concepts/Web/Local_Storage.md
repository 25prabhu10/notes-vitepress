# Local Storage

- Every site can store **5 MB** data
- You can work around it to store very large amount of data and fill up the users browser and crash it
- Every sub-domain is considered as a separate website by the browser, hence, we can save 5 MB data per subdomain that we create
- Using IFrames we can call any number of sub-domains and keep adding 5 MB of data until the browser or the computer crash
- Checkout [filldisk.com](http://www.filldisk.com/) Website that emulates this behaviour

::: tip FIXED
This has be fixed in most new versions of the browsers
