# Agile

Agile software development is an umbrella term for a set of frameworks and practices that break down complex projects into small manageable goals.

- Ability to adapt and change
- Very flexible
- Quickly adapts to changes
- Quick launch of product
- Enables fast decision-making
- Improved communication

Individuals and Interactions over Process and Tools

Steps:

1. [Read the Agile Manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/)
2. Agile is doing what is valuable
3. Don't do what is not

What Agile is not?

- Effectively determine when the work will be done

What can be done better?

- Don't Estimate (its very hard to be estimate)
  - If the cost of failure is less than the cost of planning you must not plan
  - No Bullshit Estimatation: (1 point, TFB (Too Fucking Big), NFC (No Fucking Clue))
- No Sprints, instead build something and show it to client frequently
- The risk of metrics

- A 5-minute standup in the morning
- Around a kanban board
- With a WIP (Work in Progress) limit of team size/2: maximum amount of work that can exist in each status of a workflow
- Demo as often as you can
- NOT ALL DOCUMENTATION IS BAD, sorry I wasn't clear. I love code documentation, API docs, etc., what I don't like is process documentation, overhead documentation, all the stuff that literally doesn't matter if you don't do it.
