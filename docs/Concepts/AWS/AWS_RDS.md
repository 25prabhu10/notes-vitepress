# AWS RDS Overview

- RDS stands for Relational Database Service
- It's a managed DB service for DB use SQL as a query language.
- It allows you to create databases in the cloud that are managed by AWS
  - Postgres
  - MySQL
  - MariaDB
  - Oracle
  - Microsoft SQL Server
  - Aurora (AWS Proprietary database)

## Advantage over using RDS versus deploying DB on EC2

- RDS is a managed service:
  - Automated provisioning, OS patching
  - Continuous backups and restore to specific timestamp (Point in Time Restore)!
  - Monitoring dashboards
  - Read replicas for improved read performance
  - Multi AZ setup for DR (Disaster Recovery)
  - Maintenance windows for upgrades
  - Scaling capability (vertical and horizontal)
  - Storage backed by EBS (gp2 or io1)
- BUT you can't SSH into your instances

## RDS Backups

- Backups are automatically enabled in RDS
- Automated backups:
  - Daily full backup of the database (during the maintenance window)
  - Transaction logs are backed-up by RDS every 5 minutes
  - => ability to restore to any point in time (from oldest backup to 5 minutes ago)
  - 7 days retention (can be increased to 35 days)
- DB Snapshots:
  - Manually triggered by the user
  - Retention of backup for as long as you want

## RDS - Storage Auto Scaling

- Helps you increase storage on your RDS DB instance dynamically
- When RDS detects you are running out of free database storage, it scales automatically
- Avoid manually scaling your database storage
- You have to set Maximum Storage Threshold (maximum limit for DB storage)
- Automatically modify storage if:
  - Free storage is less than 10% of allocated storage
  - Low-storage lasts at least 5 minutes
  - 6 hours have passed since last modification
- Useful for applications with unpredictable workloads
- Supports all RDS database engines (MariaDB, MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, Oracle)

## RDS Read Replicas for read scalability

- Up to 5 Read Replicas
- Within AZ, Cross AZ Application or Cross Region
- Replication is ASYNC, so reads are eventually consistent
- Replicas can be promoted to their own DB
- Applications must update the connection string to leverage read replicas

### RDS Read Replicas - Use Cases

- You have a production database that is taking on normal load
- You want to run a reporting application to run some analytics
- You create a Read Replica to run the new workload there
- The production application is unaffected
- Read replicas are used for SELECT (=read) only kind of statements (not INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)

### RDS Read Replicas - Network Cost

- In AWS there's a network cost when data goes from one AZ to another
- For RDS Read Replicas within the same region, you don't pay that fee

## RDS Multi AZ (Disaster Recovery)

- SYNC replication
- One DNS name - automatic app failover to standby
- Increase availability
- Failover in case of loss of AZ, loss of network, instance or storage failure
- No manual intervention in apps
- Not used for scaling
- Multi-AZ replication is free
- Note:The Read Replicas be setup as Multi AZ for Disaster Recovery (DR)

### RDS - From Single-AZ to Multi-AZ

- Zero downtime operation (no need to stop the DB)
- Just click on "modify" for the database
- The following happens internally:
  - A snapshot is taken
  - A new DB is restored from the snapshot in a new AZ
  - Synchronization is established between the two databases

## Create a RDS

Steps:

1. Goto RDS
2. Create database
3. Choose a database creation method:

   - Standard create
   - Easy create (uses predefined configurations)

4. Engine options:

   - Amazon Aurora (not available in Free-tier)
   - MySQL
   - MariaDB
   - PostgreSQL
   - Oracle
   - Microsoft SQL Server

5. Select the edition and version of the database
6. Templates:

   - Production
   - Dev/Test
   - Free tier

7. Settings:

   - DB instance identifier (unique name)
   - Credentials Settings: Master username and password

8. DB Instance class:

   - Standard classes (includes m classes)
   - Memory optimized classes (includes r and x classes)
   - Burstable classes (includes t classes): db.t2.micro (1 vCPUs, 1 GiB RAM, Not EBS Optimized)

9. Storage:

   - Storage type (General Purpose (SSD), Provisioned IOPS (SSD), Magnetic)
   - Allocated storage (20 GiB)
   - Storage autoscaling (increase storage when specified threshold is exceeded)

10. Availability & durability: Multi-AZ deployment
11. Connectivity:

    - VPC
    - Subnet Group
    - Public access
    - VPC security group
    - Port: 3306

12. Database authentication:

    - Password authentication (using database passwords as created in step 7)
    - Password and IAM database authentication
    - Password and Kerberos authentication

13. Additional configuration:

    - Database options: Initial database name
    - Backup: Enable automated backups (snapshots)
    - Backup retention period (0 - 35 days)
    - Backup window (when the backup should happen)
    - Monitoring
    - Logging to CloudWatch
    - Maintenance: Enable auto minor version upgrade
    - Deletion protection (protects database from being deleted accidentally)

## RDS Security - Encryption

- At rest encryption
  - Possibility to encrypt the master & read replicas with AWS KMS - AES-256 encryption
  - Encryption has to be defined at launch time
  - If the master is not encrypted, the read replicas cannot be encrypted
  - Transparent Data Encryption (TDE) available for Oracle and SQL Server
- In-flight encryption
  - SSL certificates to encrypt data to RDS in flight
  - Provide SSL options with trust certificate when connecting to database
  - To enforce SSL:
    - PostgreSQL: `rds.force_ssl=1` in the AWS RDS Console (Parameter Groups)
    - MySQL: Within the DB: `GRANT USAGE ON *.* TO 'mysqluser'@'%' REQUIRE SSL;`

### RDS Encryption Operations

- Encrypting RDS backups
  - Snapshots of un-encrypted RDS databases are un-encrypted
  - Snapshots of encrypted RDS databases are encrypted
  - Can copy a snapshot into an encrypted one
- To encrypt an un-encrypted RDS database:
  - Create a snapshot of the un-encrypted database
  - Copy the snapshot and enable encryption for the snapshot
  - Restore the database from the encrypted snapshot
  - Migrate applications to the new database, and delete the old database

### RDS Security - Network & IAM

- Network Security
  - RDS databases are usually deployed within a private subnet, not in a public one
  - RDS security works by leveraging security groups (the same concept as for EC2 instances) - it controls which IP / security group can communicate with RDS
- Access Management
  - IAM policies help control who can manage AWS RDS (through the RDS API)
  - Traditional Username and Password can be used to login into the database
  - IAM-based authentication can be used to login into RDS MySQL & PostgreSQL

### RDS - IAM Authentication

- IAM database authentication works with MySQL and PostgreSQL
- You don't need a password, just an authentication token obtained through IAM & RDS API calls
- Auth token has a lifetime of 15 minutes
- Benefits:
  - Network in/out must be encrypted using SSL
  - IAM to centrally manage users instead of DB
  - Can leverage IAM Roles and EC2 Instance profiles for easy integration

### RDS Security - Summary

- Encryption at rest:
  - Is done only when you first create the DB instance
  - or: unencrypted DB => snapshot => copy snapshot as encrypted => create DB from snapshot
- Your responsibility:
  - Check the ports / IP / security group inbound rules in DB's SG
  - In-database user creation and permissions or manage through IAM
  - Creating a database with or without public access
  - Ensure parameter groups or DB is configured to only allow SSL connections
- AWS responsibility:
  - No SSH access
  - No manual DB patching
  - No manual OS patching
  - No way to audit the underlying instance

## Amazon Aurora

- Aurora is a proprietary technology from AWS (not open sourced)
- Postgres and MySQL are both supported as Aurora DB (that means your drivers will work as if Aurora was a Postgres or MySQL database)
- Aurora is "AWS cloud optimized" and claims 5x performance improvement over MySQL on RDS, over 3x the performance of Postgres on RDS
- Aurora storage automatically grows in increments of 10GB, up to 64 TB.
- Aurora can have 15 replicas while MySQL has 5, and the replication process is faster (sub 10 ms replica lag)
- Failover in Aurora is instantaneous. It's HA (High Availability) native.
- Aurora costs more than RDS (20% more) - but is more efficient

### Aurora High Availability and Read Scaling

- 6 copies of your data across 3 AZ:
- 4 copies out of 6 needed for writes
- 3 copies out of 6 need for reads
- Self healing with peer-to-peer replication
- Storage is striped across 100s of volumes
- One Aurora Instance takes writes (master)
- Automated failover for master in less than 30 seconds
- Master + up to 15 Aurora Read Replicas serve reads
- Support for Cross Region Replication

### Features of Aurora

- Automatic fail-over
- Backup and Recovery
- Isolation and security
- Industry compliance
- Push-button scaling
- Automated Patching with Zero Downtime
- Advanced Monitoring
- Routine Maintenance
- Backtrack: restore data at any point of time without using backups

### Aurora Security

- Similar to RDS because uses the same engines
- Encryption at rest using KMS
- Automated backups, snapshots and replicas are also encrypted
- Encryption in flight using SSL (same process as MySQL or Postgres)
- Possibility to authenticate using IAM token (same method as RDS)
- You are responsible for protecting the instance with security groups
- You can't SSH

## Amazon ElastiCache Overview

- The same way RDS is to get managed Relational Databases...
- ElastiCache is to get managed Redis or Memcached
- Caches are in-memory databases with really high performance, low latency
- Helps reduce load off of databases for read intensive workloads
- Helps make your application stateless
- AWS takes care of OS maintenance / patching, optimizations, setup, configuration, monitoring, failure recovery and backups
- Using ElastiCache involves heavy application code changes

### Solution Architecture - DB Cache

- Applications queries ElastiCache, if not available, get from RDS and store in ElastiCache.
- Helps relieve load in RDS
- Cache must have an invalidation strategy to make sure only the most current data is used in there.

### Solution Architecture - User Session Store

- User logs into any of the application
- The application writes the session data into ElastiCache
- The user hits another instance of our application
- The instance retrieves the data and the user is already logged in

### ElastiCache - Redis vs Memcached

| REDIS                                                   | MEMCACHED                                      |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Multi AZ with Auto-Failover                             | Multi-node for partitioning of data (sharding) |
| Read Replicas to scale reads and have high availability | No high availability (replication)             |
| Data Durability using AOF persistence                   | Non persistent                                 |
| Backup and restore features                             | No backup and restore                          |
|                                                         | Multi-threaded architecture                    |

### ElastiCache - Cache Security

- All caches in ElastiCache:
  - Do not support IAM authentication
  - IAM policies on ElastiCache are only used for AWS API-level security
- Redis AUTH
  - You can set a "password/token" when you create a Redis cluster
  - This is an extra level of security for your cache (on top of security groups)
  - Support SSL in flight encryption
- Memcached
  - Supports SASL-based authentication (advanced)

### ElastiCache Replication: Cluster Mode Disabled

- One primary node, up to 5 replicas
- Asynchronous Replication
- The primary node is used for read/write
- The other nodes are read-only
- One shard, all nodes have all the data
- Guard against data loss if node failure
- Multi-AZ enabled by default for failover
- Helpful to scale read performance

### ElastiCache Replication: Cluster Mode Enabled

- Data is partitioned across shards (helpful to scale writes)
- Each shard has a primary and up to 5 replica nodes (same concept as before)
- Multi-AZ capability
- Up to 500 nodes per cluster:
  - 500 shards with single master
  - 250 shards with 1 master and 1 replica
  - ...
  - 83 shards with one master and 5 replicas

### Caching Implementation Considerations

- Read more at: [AWS caching implementation](https://aws.amazon.com/caching/implementation-considerations/)
- Is it safe to cache data? Data may be out of date, eventually consistent
- Is caching effective for that data?
  - Pattern: data changing slowly, few keys are frequently needed
  - Anti patterns: data changing rapidly, all large key space frequently needed
- Is data structured well for caching?
  - example: key value caching, or caching of aggregations results
- Which caching design pattern is the most appropriate?

1. Lazy Loading / Cache-Aside / Lazy Population

   - Pros
     - Only requested data is cached (the cache isn't filled up with unused data)
     - Node failures are not fatal (just increased latency to warm the cache)
   - Cons
     - Cache miss penalty that results in 3 round trips, noticeable delay for that request
     - Stale data: data can be updated in the database and outdated in the cache

   _Example:_

   ```python
   def get_user(user_id):
       # Check the cache
       record = cache.get(user_id)

       if record is None:
           # Run a DB query
           record = db.query("select * from users where id = ?", user_id)
           # Populate the cache
           cache.ser(user_id, record)
           return record
       else:
           return record

   # App code
   user = get_user(19)
   ```

2. Write Through - Add or Update cache when database is updated

   - Pros:
     - Data in cache is never stale, reads are quick
     - Write penalty vs Read penalty (each write requires 2 calls)
   - Cons:
     - Missing Data until it is added / updated in the DB. Mitigation is to implement Lazy Loading strategy as well
     - Cache churn - a lot of the data will never be read RDS

   _Example:_

   ```python
   def save_user(user_id, values):
       # Save to DB
       record = db.query("update users ... where id = ?", user_id, values)
       # Push into cache
       cache.set(user_id, record)
       return record

   # App code
   user = save_user(17, {"name": "Nate Dogg"})
   ```

3. Cache Evictions and Time-to-live (TTL)

   - Cache eviction can occur in three ways:
     - You delete the item explicitly in the cache
     - Item is evicted because the memory is full and it's not recently used (LRU)
     - You set an item time-to-live (or TTL)
   - TTL are helpful for any kind of data:
     - Leaderboards
     - Comments
     - Activity streams
   - TTL can range from few seconds to hours or days
   - If too many evictions happen due to memory, you should scale up or out

Final words of wisdom

- Lazy Loading / Cache aside is easy to implement and works for many situations as a foundation, especially on the read side
- Write-through is usually combined with Lazy Loading as targeted for the queries or workloads that benefit from this optimization
- Setting a TTL is usually not a bad idea, except when you're using Write-through. Set it to a sensible value for your application
- Only cache the data that makes sense (user profiles, blogs, etc...)
