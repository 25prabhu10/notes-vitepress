# Checkmarx

Checkmarx is a static code analysis tool that will assist developers to identify security vulnerabilities prior to code being deployed to production.

- Determine the security posture for an application
- Support delivering security at scale
- Identify vulnerabilities sooner in the SDLC
- Accelerate time to remediation

Checkmarx **scans source code** (not compiled binaries) and creates a **code graph**, which it queries using **CxQL**.

- Queries are designed to be specific to each programming language and vulnerability type
- Supports 20+ languages and frameworks
- Results can be accessed via a web portal or via source control and CI integrations
