# Programming Paradigms

Common Programming paradigms:

- **Imperative**: in which the programmer instructs the machine how to change its state

  1. Procedural: which groups instructions into procedures

  2. [Object-Oriented Programming](./Object-Oriented_Programming.md): which groups instructions with the part of the state they operate on

- **Declarative**: in which the programmer merely declares properties of the desired result, but not how to compute it

  1. [Functional](./Functional.md): in which the desired result is declared as the value of a series of function applications

  2. Logic: in which the desired result is declared as the answer to a question about a system of facts and rules

  3. Mathematical: in which the desired result is declared as the solution of an optimization problem

  4. Reactive: in which the desired result is declared with data streams and the propagation of change
